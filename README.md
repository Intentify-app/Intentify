## Why Intentify

I have been using Alfred for over a decade (I know there is Raycast, thanks), but recently I found that Spotlight in macOS 26 is not bad. In particular, it can now run [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts-mac/welcome/mac) actions inline with input.

As someone who relies primarily on first-party apps, I have decided to give Spotlight another try.

Since Shortcuts' built-in scripting has [many limitations](https://github.com/Intentify-app/Intentify/wiki#why-intentify-is-better), I created this tool to make extending it easier.

I may add more features in the future (such as more extensible or better result display), but do not expect it to compete with Alfred or Raycast.

I love simple things.
